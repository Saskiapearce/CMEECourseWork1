CMEECourseWork1
Overview

This repository contains coursework for the Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE) programming bootcamp. The repository is organized into weekly folders, with each week focusing on different tools and programming languages used in ecological and evolutionary modeling.

Each week contains four subfolders:

    Code: Contains all the scripts written during the coursework.
    Data: Holds datasets used for the analysis and exercises.
    Results: Stores the output generated by the code, such as processed data and results.
    Sandbox: A space for experimental or draft scripts and testing different approaches.

Week 1: Bash and Linux Shell Scripting

Purpose: This folder contains exercises and scripts related to the basics of Bash and Linux shell commands.

    Code: Contains shell scripts (.sh files) that demonstrate:
        Command-line tools for file manipulation including gep.
        Automating tasks with bash scripts.
        File and directory handling, and piping commands.
    Data: Input files used by the bash scripts, such as text files, log files, or tabular data.
    Results: Output generated by the shell scripts.
    Sandbox: Contains draft or experimental bash scripts for testing purposes.

Week 2: Python Scripting

Purpose: This folder focuses on exercises related to Python programming, primarily for data manipulation, analysis, and basic scripting.

    Code: Contains Python scripts (.py files) demonstrating:
        Basic Python syntax and data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets).
        File I/O operations (reading/writing .csv, .txt files).
        Simple data analysis and processing tasks.
        Example: align_seqs.py which aligns DNA sequences.
    Data: CSV or text files used as input for the Python scripts.
    Results: Output generated from Python scripts, such as processed data or visualization outputs.
    Sandbox: A space for testing experimental Python code or trying out new libraries.

Week 3: R Programming

Purpose: This folder contains exercises related to R programming, primarily for statistical analysis and data visualization.

    Code: Contains R scripts (.R files) focusing on:
        Basic R syntax and functions.
        Data manipulation with dplyr and tidyverse.
        Generating plots and visualizations with ggplot2.
        Statistical analyses and ecological modeling.
    Data: Datasets used for the R scripts, typically in .csv format.
    Results: Contains outputs from R scripts, such as plots, summary statistics, and analysis results.
    Sandbox: A space for testing new approaches or experimenting with R packages.

Week 4: Statistical Analysis

Purpose: This folder is a continuation of R scripting, focusing on data management, linear models, generalised linear models and statistical power analysis.

    Code: Contains R scripts (.R files) demonstrating:
        Advanced data manipulation 
        Working generalised linear models, linear models and statistical analysis.
        Example: GLM02.R for generalised linear models analysis, using workerbees.csv.
    Data: Files used for analysis in the R scripts, typically in .csv format.
    Results: Output generated by the scripts, including tables, plots, or other analyses.
    Sandbox: Not used
    
 Week 5: GIS Programming 
 
 Purpose: This folder is a continuation of R scripting, focusing on geographical data anaylesis using Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis, including vector and raster data processing, visualization, and spatial analysis. The workflow integrates multiple R packages to manipulate spatial data, create custom geometries, project coordinates, and perform rasterization. Additionally, it incorporates climate data visualization and topographical mapping. 
    Code: Contains R scripts (.R files) demonstrating:
        Custom polygons and points for UK and Ireland regions
        Raster maps for temperature, elevation, and aggregated/disaggregated values.
        Example: GIS Practical 1 for Temperature maps for January, July, and annual maximum temperatures
    Data: Files used for analysis in the R scripts, typically in .shp format.
    Results: Output generated by the scripts, including tables, plots, or other visualisations
    Sandbox: Not used
