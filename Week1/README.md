CMEECourseWork

Title: Week 1 Biological Computing Bootcamp

Brief Description:

This repository contains coursework for the Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE), specifically focusing on biological computing tasks using Linux and shell scripting. The exercises are based on TheMulQuaBio course notes (https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html) from the Biological Computing course at the Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London.

Project Structure and Usage: The repository contains code scripts located in the Code folder. The Data folder includes input files used by some scripts, while the sandbox folder contains experimental files and is not essential to the main coursework. Output files are generated in the results folder for this week’s coursework.

Project Structure

    Code folder: Contains all scripts.
    Data folder: Includes input files used by scripts.
    Results folder: Stores output files generated by the scripts.
    Sandbox folder: Used for experimental work (not essential for the coursework).

Languages:

    Linux Shell Scripting (Tested on version 21.3.0)

Dependencies:

    None: All scripts use basic shell commands, which should be available in most Linux distributions.

Installation:

To clone this repository, use the following command:
bash
git clone git@github.com:Saskiapearce/CMEECourseWork.git

Project Structure and Usage:
The repository contains 10 primary scripts located in the Code folder. The Data folder includes input files used by some scripts, while the sandbox folder contains experimental files and is not essential to the main coursework. Output files are generated in the results folder for this week’s coursework.

Overview of the scripts:

Boilerplate.sh

Purpose:
Prints a sample text as a demonstration of shell script syntax.

Usage:
Run without arguments to display a sample text output.

Input:
None.

Output:
A simple string: "This is a boilerplate".

Example:

bash

bash Boilerplate.sh

variables.sh

Purpose:
Prints a given string and adds two provided numbers.

Usage:
Takes one string and two numerical inputs.

Input:
A string and two numbers.

Output:
Prints the provided string and the sum of the two numbers.

Example:

bash

bash variables.sh "Hello" 6 7
# Output:
# Hello
# 13

MyExampleScript.sh

Purpose:
Displays a greeting message using a predefined message and the current user’s name (an environmental variable).

Usage:
Run the script to print a customized greeting for the current user.

Input:
No external input; uses the USER environmental variable.

Output:
Prints two greeting messages:

    "Hello <username>" using USER variable.
    "Hello <username>" using direct echo statement.

Dependencies:
None.

Example:

bash

bash MyExampleScript.sh
# Output:
# Hello <username>
# Hello <username>

tabtocsv.sh

Purpose:
Converts a tab-delimited file to a comma-separated CSV file, saving it in the results directory.

Usage:
Run the script with a single .tab file as an argument.

Input:
A .tab file in the data directory.

Output:
A CSV file saved in the results directory with _2.csv appended to the filename.

Dependencies:
None.

Example:

bash

bash tabtocsv.sh example.tab
# Output:
# Converting tab file to csv file...
# Done! File saved to ../results/example_2.csv

CountLine.sh

Purpose:
Counts the number of lines in a specified file located in the data directory.

Usage:
Run the script with a single filename as an argument.

Input:
A single file provided as an argument.

Output:
Displays the number of lines in the specified file.

Dependencies:
None.

Example:

bash

bash CountLine.sh example.txt
# Output:
# Counting lines in file
# The file example.txt has [Number of lines] lines

If no file is specified or more than one argument is provided:

bash

bash CountLine.sh
# Output:
# Put in 1 single file.

ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh

Purpose:
Merges two specified files into a new file in the results directory.

Usage:

bash

./ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh <file1> <file2> <file3>

Input:
Three file names; the first two files are combined and saved under the name of the third file.

Output:
A new merged file in the results directory.

Example:

bash

bash ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh file1.txt file2.txt combined.txt

tiff2png.sh

Purpose:
Converts all .tif files in the current directory to .png format.

Usage:
Run the script in a directory containing .tif files.

Input:
One or more .tif files.

Output:
.png files with the same base name as the .tif files.

Dependencies:
Requires ImageMagick for the convert command.

Example:

bash

bash tiff2png.sh
# Output:
# Converting file1.tif
# Converting file2.tif
# ...
# (or "No .tif files found in the directory" if no .tif files are present)

csvtospace.sh

Purpose:
Converts a comma-delimited CSV file to a space-delimited text file.

Usage:
Run the script with a CSV filename to convert it to a space-delimited file in the results directory.

Input:
A .csv file in the data directory.

bash

bash csvtospace.sh example.csv
# Output:
# Converting comma-delimited CSV file to space-delimited ...
# Done! File saved to ../results/example_2.txt

Translate.sh

Purpose:
Performs text transformations, including removing excess spaces, deleting all 'a's, converting text to uppercase, and keeping only numbers.

Usage:
Run the script to apply transformations to predefined text strings.

Input:
None; the script includes predefined text examples.

Output:
Prints transformed text for each example.

Dependencies:
None.

Example:

bash

bash Translate.sh
# Output:
# Remove excess spaces.
# Remove ll the 's
# SET TO UPPERCASE
# 10.00 1.33

UnixPrac1.sh

Purpose:
Analyzes FASTA files by counting lines, printing sequence data, counting characters, counting "ATGC" sequences, and calculating the AT/GC ratio.

Usage:
Run the script to analyze .fasta files in the data directory.

Input:
One or more .fasta files in the data directory.

Output:

    Number of lines.
    All sequences from line 2 onward.
    Total number of characters.
    Count of "ATGC" sequences.
    AT/GC ratio.
