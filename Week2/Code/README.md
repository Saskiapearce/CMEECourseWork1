CMEECourseWork

Title: Week 2 Biological Computing Bootcamp

Brief Description:

This repository contains coursework for the Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE), specifically focusing on biological computing tasks using Linux and shell scripting. The exercises are based on TheMulQuaBio course notes (https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html) from the Biological Computing course at the Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London.

Project Structure and Usage: The repository contains code scripts located in the Code folder. The Data folder includes input files used by some scripts, while the sandbox folder contains experimental files and is not essential to the main coursework. Output files are generated in the results folder for this week’s coursework.

Languages: 
python version 3.9 

Project Structure

    Code folder: Contains all scripts.
    Data folder: Includes input files used by scripts.
    Results folder: Stores output files generated by the scripts.
    Sandbox folder: Used for experimental work (not essential for the coursework).

    Output: A CSV file collating species body mass.

basic_io1.py

    Purpose: Imports and processes a text file by printing lines longer than 0 characters.
    Input: A text file (test.txt).
    Output: Prints non-empty lines.

basic_io2.py

    Purpose: Saves elements of a list to a text file.
    Input: A list of integers generated using range(100).

basic_io3.py

    Purpose: Demonstrates storing/retrieving complex objects using Python’s pickle module.
    Input: A dictionary object.
    Output: A binary file (testp.p) containing the serialized object and prints it after reloading.

boilerplate.py

    Purpose: Simple script demonstrating a boilerplate program structure.
    Input: None.
    Output: Prints "this is a simple boilerplate".

Mathematical Utility Functions:

    Purpose: Utility functions for square root, finding larger numbers, sorting, and factorials.
    Input: Numeric values (integers or floats).
    Output: Returns mathematical results (square roots, larger numbers, factorials, etc.).

cfexercise2.py

    Purpose: Demonstrates loops and conditionals with various example functions.
    Input: Integers (depending on the function).
    Output: Prints "hello" messages based on the conditions within loops.

control_flow.py

    Purpose: Demonstrates control flow (if/else, loops) to check prime numbers, divisors, etc.
    Input: Integer values.
    Output: Displays whether numbers are prime, even/odd, and lists of prime numbers.

debugme.py

    Purpose: Uses ipdb for debugging. Intentionally contains a division by zero error.
    Input: An integer passed to the function.
    Output: Prints debugging information to identify the division by zero error.

dictionary.py

    Purpose: Categorizes species into taxonomic orders using dictionaries and sets.
    Input: A predefined set of species and their taxonomic orders.
    Output: Prints species grouped by taxonomic order.

lc1.py

    Purpose: Extracts bird species data (Latin name, common name, body mass) using list comprehensions and loops.
    Input: Tuple of bird data (Latin name, common name, body mass).
    Output: Three separate lists for Latin names, common names, and body masses.

lc2.py

    Purpose: Filters monthly rainfall data using list comprehensions and loops.
    Input: Predefined tuple with month names and rainfall amounts.
    Output: Lists of months where rainfall is greater than 100mm or less than 50mm.

loops.py

    Purpose: Demonstrates basic for and while loops in Python.
    Input: None (predefined lists and variables).
    Output: Prints loop iterations and cumulative sums.

MyExampleScript.py

    Purpose: Demonstrates a function (foo) that squares a number.
    Input: A single integer.
    Output: Prints the square of the input.

oaks.py

    Purpose: Identifies oak species using for loops and list comprehensions.
    Input: A predefined list of species.
    Output: Prints oak species and converts their names to uppercase.
    
Oaks_debugme.py
    Purpose: reads a CSV file of species data (TestOaksData.csv)
    Input: A CSV file containing species names (TestOaksData.csv).
    Output: A CSV file (JustOaksData.csv) containing only oak species.

scope.py

    Purpose: Demonstrates local and global variable scopes.
    Input: None (predefined global variables).
    Output: Displays the values of variables inside and outside functions.

sysargv.py

    Purpose: Demonstrates how to use sys.argv to pass and access command-line arguments.
    Input: Command-line arguments.
    Output: Prints the name of the script, the number of arguments, and the arguments themselves.

test_control_flow.py

    Purpose: Tests control flow using the even_or_odd function with doctest.
    Input: Integers for the even_or_odd function.
    Output: Prints whether numbers are even or odd and runs doctest.

tuple.py

    Purpose: Demonstrates tuple usage by printing bird species details (Latin name, common name, mass).
    Input: A predefined tuple of bird species.
    Output: Prints Latin name, common name, and mass for each bird.

using_name.py

    Purpose: Demonstrates how the __name__ variable behaves when a script is run directly or imported.
    Input: None.
    Output: Prints whether the script is being run directly or imported.
