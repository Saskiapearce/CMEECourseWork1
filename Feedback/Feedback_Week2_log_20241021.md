# Feedback on Project Structure, Workflow, and Python Code

## Project Structure and Workflow

### General Structure
- **Repository Layout**: The project is organized with distinct directories for each week (`Week1`, `Week2`, `Week3`), which is helpful for separating tasks. Each directory contains subfolders for `Code`, `Data`, `Results`, and `Sandbox`, keeping everything well-organized.
- **.gitignore File**: The `.gitignore` file excludes unnecessary files like `*.tmp` and `.DS_Store`. Consider extending it to exclude files such as `__pycache__`, `.pkl`, or any other temporary files generated during script execution.
- **README Files**: The main `README.md` provides a broad overview of the repository's structure. It is informative, but there is room for improvement:
  - **Dependencies**: Some scripts (e.g., `debugme.py`) use external modules like `ipdb`. Make sure to list all external dependencies in the README or include a `requirements.txt` file.
  - **Usage Instructions**: The README includes brief instructions but would benefit from more detailed examples showing how to run the scripts, especially for those taking command-line arguments (e.g., `align_seqs.py`).

### Workflow
- **Results Directory**: The `Results` directory contains output files like `DNA_seq.txt` and `JustOaksData.csv`. It is a good practice to keep the directory empty by default and not track result files in version control. Consider adding a `.gitkeep` file to keep the directory structure intact.
- **Sandbox Directory**: The `sandbox` folder is being used as a space for experimental code, which is good. Make sure that any final or important scripts are moved to the `Code` folder once tested.
 
## Python Code Feedback

### General Code Quality
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: While the code generally follows Python's standards, there are minor issues with spacing and indentation that should be corrected. Strict adherence to PEP 8 will improve readability.
- **Docstrings**: Most scripts include docstrings, which is good practice. However, some are missing script-level docstrings or function-level explanations. Ensure that each script and function has a detailed docstring explaining the purpose, parameters, and return values.
- **Error Handling**: Many scripts assume that files exist in specific locations without checking. Add file existence checks and handle potential errors (e.g., missing files or malformed input) to make the code more robust.

### Detailed Code Review

#### `basic_io1.py`
- **File Handling**: The script demonstrates basic file input but lacks error handling for missing files. Use the `with open()` context manager for file operations to ensure files are closed properly, even if an error occurs.

#### `basic_io2.py`
- **File Output**: Similar to `basic_io1.py`, this script handles file writing but would benefit from error handling and using `with open()` for safer file operations.

#### `cfexercise1.py`
- **Redundancy**: The script includes multiple factorial functions (`foo_4`, `foo_5`, `foo_6`) that could be refactored for simplicity. Annotate these functions  to explain how they demonstrate different approaches (iterative vs. recursive).
- **Docstrings**: Most functions have adequate docstrings, but the script would benefit from a more detailed description of its overall purpose.

#### `cfexercise2.py`
- **Control Flow**: The script demonstrates loops and conditionals effectively. However, it could use more detailed docstrings for individual functions to clarify the logic and behavior of the loops.

#### `align_seqs.py`
- **Modularization**: The sequence alignment logic is correct but could be further modularized. Breaking down the main alignment routine into smaller functions would improve readability and make future debugging easier.
- **Error Handling**: Add file existence checks for the input CSV files. The current implementation crashes if the file is missing, which could be avoided by adding error handling.

#### `oaks_debugme.py`
- **Error Handling**: The script works well for identifying oak species, but it could handle missing or malformed CSV files better. Adding exception handling around file reading and writing would make it more robust.
- **Doctests**: It’s good that doctests are used to validate the `is_an_oak` function. Expanding the test cases to cover more edge cases (e.g., variations in input format) would improve coverage.

#### `loops.py`
- **Loops and Control Flow**: The script provides clear examples of for-loops and while-loops, but it lacks function-level docstrings. Adding detailed comments or docstrings explaining the purpose of each loop would improve code clarity.

#### `scope.py`
- **Scope Demonstrations**: This script successfully demonstrates the use of global and local variables, but there is an error when attempting to access an undefined local variable (`_a_local`). Add checks or refactor the code to avoid such errors.

#### `debugme.py`
- **Debugging Example**: The script demonstrates debugging techniques using `ipdb`. However, the `ipdb` dependency should be mentioned in the README or added to a `requirements.txt` file. Also, add comments or docstrings to explain the purpose of debugging for educational purposes.

#### `test_control_flow.py`
- **Doctests and Control Flow**: The script is well-structured with clear examples of control flow. It uses doctests effectively to validate the behavior of its functions. Expanding the test cases would improve coverage.

#### `dictionary.py`
- **Dictionary Operations**: The script demonstrates dictionary operations well but could be optimized using `defaultdict` from Python’s `collections` module. This would make the code cleaner and more efficient.

### Final Remarks
The project demonstrates a good understanding of Python programming, including file handling, control flow, and data structures. However, it could be improved by:
1. Ensuring all scripts and functions have complete docstrings.
2. Adding more robust error handling for file operations.
3. Refactoring redundant code to improve maintainability and readability.
