## General Project Structure and Workflow

- **Directory Organization**: The project is well-organized, with weekly folders (`Week1`, `Week2`, `Week3`) and clear subdirectories (`code`, `data`, `results`, `sandbox`). This structure enhances readability and allows easy navigation through each week’s tasks and outputs.
- **README Files**: The README files provide an overview of each week’s focus and instructions on dependencies. However, adding specific usage examples for key scripts, such as `DataWrang.R`, `apply1.R`, `Girko.R`, and `TreeHeight.R`, could further clarify how to run these scripts and interpret outputs.

### Suggested Improvements:
1. **Expand README Files**: Include usage examples, input/output details, and expected results for complex scripts.


### General Code Suggestions

- **Consistency**: Ensure consistent spacing and indentation across scripts for readability.
- **Error Handling**: Consider enhancing error handling, such as using `tryCatch()` in `try.R`, to allow for controlled responses to errors.
- **Comments**: Add more explanatory comments to complex scripts like `DataWrang.R` and `Girko.R` for easier understanding.
